<h4>Installing Python On Your computer</h4>
First of all, you need to install python on your computer. For downloading python visit python.org. You should better download python version 3.7 or higher. While installing the python make sure you have tick marked “Add Python To PATH” otherwise you will get an error while installing any module or library in python.

Add python to the path variable<br>
If you want to check whether python is successfully installed on your computer or not. Just go to cmd or terminal whatever you have on your computer and type python. There you can see which version of python has been installed on your computer. If it does show the version of python like in the image below you could not have followed the steps properly. You should recheck the previous steps carefully.

The above image that is in my case, it’s showing the 3.9 version. Yours will be different as per the python version you have installed.

<h4>Pygame</h4>

If you are not aware of what the pygame is? Basically, pygame is a free and open-source cross-platform library for the development of multimedia applications like video games using Python. It uses the Simple DirectMedia Layer library and several other popular libraries to abstract the most common functions, making writing these programs a more intuitive task.

<h4>How To install pygame?</h4>

First of all, you need to install python on your computer, and along with that install python-pip. Python uses pip to install packages.

In order to install pygame on your computer write the below code in your cmd or terminal.

<code>pip install pygame pytmx</code>

After downloading the zip file of the source code all you need to do is extract it and navigate to the next folder and after that, you have to run the main.py file.<br>
